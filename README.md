## Always ask why? Is this the best solution?
The answer is certainly no from my point of view, so I started to revamp it begin at the December, because of the passion.

There is always a question around me, is there a programming language that is more suitable for achieving the effect than p5.js, so I tried to combine it with UI, and wanted to achieve the following interactive effect. 
## Explore the opportunity

Finally, I found that this action can be successfully implemented on the source model of [*Meta*](https://sketch.metademolab.com/canvas), and it is far better than using the traditional model method. These new coding have opened the door to a new world for me.
